# Video drivers selection for rockchip soc. These configs only impact the
# compile process. You can surely check all the options. In this case, all the
# display driver will be compiled, but which drivers finally  will be used is
# decided by device tree configuration. What's more, enable needed power for
# display by configure the device tree, and the vop driver will do the rest.

	help
	  STARFIVE SoCs provide video output capabilities for High-Definition
	  Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Low-voltage Differential Signalling
	  (LVDS), embedded DisplayPort (eDP) and Display Serial Interface (DSI).

	  This driver supports the on-chip video output device, and targets the
	  STARFIVE RK3288 and RK3399.

	default 1920
	help
	  The maximum horizontal resolution to support for the framebuffer.
	  This configuration is used for reserving/allocating memory for the
	  framebuffer during device-model binding/probing.

config VIDEO_STARFIVE_MAX_YRES
        int "Maximum vertical resolution (for memory allocation purposes)"
	depends on VIDEO_STARFIVE

	default 1080
	help
	  The maximum vertical resolution to support for the framebuffer.
	  This configuration is used for reserving/allocating memory for the
	  framebuffer during device-model binding/probing.

config DISPLAY_STARFIVE_EDP
	bool "EDP Port"
	depends on VIDEO_STARFIVE
	help
	  This enables Embedded DisplayPort(EDP) display support.

config DISPLAY_STARFIVE_LVDS
	bool "LVDS Port"
	depends on VIDEO_STARFIVE
	help
	  This enables Low-voltage Differential Signaling(LVDS) display
	  support.

config DISPLAY_STARFIVE_HDMI
	bool "HDMI port"
	select VIDEO_DW_HDMI
	depends on VIDEO_STARFIVE
	help
	  This enables High-Definition Multimedia Interface display support.

config DISPLAY_STARFIVE_MIPI
	bool "MIPI Port"
	depends on VIDEO_STARFIVE
	help
	  This enables Mobile Industry Processor Interface(MIPI) display
	  support. The mipi controller and dphy on rk3288& rk3399 support
	  16,18, 24 bits per pixel with up to 2k resolution ratio.

config VIDEO_NW_MIPI_DSI
	bool "DSI host"
	select VIDEO_MIPI_DSI
	help
	  Enables the common driver code for the Northwest
	  MIPI DSI block found in SoCs from various vendors.
	  As this does not provide any functionality by itself (but
	  rather requires a SoC-specific glue driver to call it), it
	  can not be enabled from the configuration menu.
