config AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	bool
	help
	  Enable support for Allwinner's physical layer for spinand.
	  It's a command physical layer, used by both AW-nand with nftl and
	  MTD-nand with ubi.

config AW_SPINAND_NONSTANDARD_SPI_DRIVER
	bool
	help
	  Use NONSTANDARD spi controller driver for spinand. It's mamy
	  bugs on standard spi driver when we developing, that's why the
	  nonstandard spi driver existed.

config AW_SPINAND_ENABLE_PHY_CRC16
	bool "check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer"
	depends on AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	help
	  It is experimental.
	  To check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer.

config AW_SPINAND_PSTORE_MTD_PART
	bool "create pstore mtd partition for aw ubi spinand"
	depends on AW_MTD_SPINAND
	help
	  Whether create pstore mtd partition, which is need by pstroe-blk.
	  If you want linux kernel dump log to spinand when oops/panic, you
	  should create pstreo mtd partition by this configure.

	  If unsure, say no.

config AW_MTD_SPINAND_UBOOT_BLKS
	int "Blocks Count Reserved For Uboot"

	range 0 33
	help
	  How many reserved blocks for uboot and uboot's copy?
	  It's must in range [1,33]. If 0, set it automatically.
	  The larger it is, the more uboot copies to save.

	  WARNING!!!
	  If it is change, the secure storage may be erased!
	  Once changed, the image will be incompatible to old image.

	  if unsure, set it 0.

	default y
	help
	  spinand do not support multiplane. In order to adapt to aw nand
	  we simulate multiplane. If set, the common physical layer should
	  merge two continuous physical block to 'super block' for logical
	  layer.

	  Merge pages in two adjacent blocks with the same page num to super
	  page. Merge adjacent blocks to super block.

		aw spinand do not support read raw spare data by default, say yes to

		if enable AW_MTD_SPINAND_OOB_RAW_SPARE, the oob is equivalent to spare area,
		otherwise oob is the user data spare area in ecc protected.
